    "As a data scientist working for the UK government, I explored a provided SQLite database (`accident_data_v1.0.0_2023.db`) containing road accident data.\n",

    "The main objectives were to:\n",
    "1. Identify the **oldest driver or rider**.  \n",
    "2. Count all **vehicles of type 19**.  \n",
    "3. Retrieve details of **accidents in Kingston upon Hull** using table joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used **Python (sqlite3 + pandas)** to execute SQL queries, view results, and prepare screenshots for my presentation.\n"
