This repository presents my **SQL relational database project** developed for the **MSc Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** programme at the **University of Hull – London Campus (QA Higher Education)**.

It demonstrates the design, implementation, and querying of a **relational database** built to analyse UK road accident data while ensuring **ethical, legal, and technical responsibility** in data handling.

## 📘 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** `accident_data_v1.0.0_2023.db`  
- **Scenario:** Acting as a government data scientist, designing a secure and normalized SQL database.  
- **Goal:** Enable efficient data analysis and ensure responsible management of accident data.

## 🧩 Key Tasks and Achievements

| Task | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Entity–Relationship Model (ERD)** | Created tables with proper Primary and Foreign Keys to maintain data integrity. |
| **Aggregate Queries** | Used SQL aggregate functions to find the *oldest driver or rider*. |
| **Filtering & Counting** | Applied `WHERE` conditions to count *vehicles of type 19*. |
| **Complex Joins** | Combined multiple tables to display accident details: driver sex, casualty sex, speed limit, vehicle age, and region. |
| **Ethical & Legal Compliance** | Followed GDPR (2018) standards and ensured fairness in data usage. |

## ⚖️ Responsible Data Management

| Aspect | Practice |
|--------|-----------|
| **Technical** | Data integrity, normalization, and access control |
| **Ethical** | Fair, unbiased, and transparent data use |
| **Legal** | Compliance with **GDPR (2018)** and lawful data handling |
